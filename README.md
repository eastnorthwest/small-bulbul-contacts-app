# Week 5 Assessment: Contacts App

A contacts manager web application built with Express and PostgreSQL.

Part of the application has already been built for you. Your job is to take it to completion.

## Setup

Run `$ npm run` to see the list of commands available.

The app uses a basic Express file structure, and includes SQL files to set up the schema and import data.

```sh
contacts.sql        # basic import contacts data (just name)
contacts_full.sql   # full import of contacts data (all fields)
database.js         # database connection and queries
package.json        # npm standard
public/             # static assets go here
README.md           # you are here
schema.sql          # define database schema here
server.js           # web server
views/              # html templates go here
```
